# DASIP 2021: Workshop on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing in conjunction with the 16th HiPEAC Conference

**18-20 January 2021, Budapest, Hungary.**

**Virtual event**

The **Workshop on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing (DASIP)** provides an inspiring international forum for the latest innovations and developments in the field of leading signal, image and video processing and machine learning in custom embedded, edge and cloud computing architectures and systems. The workshop program will include keynote speeches and contributed paper sessions. The 14th edition will be held in conjunction with the [16th HiPEAC Conference](https://www.hipeac.net/2021/budapest/#/) in Budapest, Hungary, January 18-20, 2021. Due to the current Covid-19 situation the HiPEC’21 conference will be a **virtual event**.

## Paper submission​
Authors should submit their full papers (up to 12 pages, single-column ACM format) in PDF through the [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dasip2021) system. Please use the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) template (Latex only, Master Article Template – sample-manuscript.tex). It is also available in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (ACM Conference Proceedings „Master” Template). 

Submitted papers are required to describe original unpublished work and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Submissions must be fully anonymous, but authors should not hide previous work, instead, they need to make self-references in the third person.

Each submission will receive at least three independent double blind reviews from the members of our scientific committee. Authors will be encouraged to take the reviewers’ comments into account when they prepare the final versions of their papers and present the research during the workshop prior to its publication. The workshop proceedings will be published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Paper and keynote presentation slides and tutorial documents will be made available to workshop attendees after the workshop (subject to confidentiality issues).

The authors of DASIP 2021 best papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a  special issue in [Journal of Signal Processing Systems (JSPS)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11265/).

 
## Workshop format
We would like to propose a workshop format to have the research results presented with an in-depth scientific discussion without unnecessary time pressure:

* presentation time 15 min + 5 min for questions and discussion,
* additional session devoted to discussion on topics selected by the participants,
* an interesting keynote.
